#Cryptography

A collection of small programs I wrote while learning about cryptography.

##Diffie-Hellman

Two things: a little Python program which shows how Alice and Bob
establish a shared secret whilst communicating over insecure channels
(really it's all happening in one function, soo)

The other is another small program that uses the same Diffie-Hellman key
exchange function to encrypt and then decrypt a message using the DH
secret for repeating key XOR. Cool!

##TODO

- RSA
- Diffie-Hellman messaging app!
- AES
